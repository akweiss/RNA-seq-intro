# Introductory RNA-seq Using Command Line Programs and R

This repo contains my work done on a basic RNA sequencing project, following the example provided in Pertea M, Kim, Pertea G, Leek & Salzberg's [Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with HISAT, StringTie, and Ballgown](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.095). I knew virtually nothing about RNA-seq techniques going into this project, so a considerable amount of my time was spent reading and doing research to understand the concepts being presented. My motivation for wanting to do this was purely out of my own curiosity; computational biology and biological data analysis are fields that I'm deeply interested in, and I wanted to leverage my programming knowledge to give myself a better understanding of both.

In the future I would love to do a similar, slightly more ambitious project like this to further expand my understanding. There were so many tools and terms that came up throughout the process that were completely unfamiliar to me, but fortunately I felt confident enough in my programming abilities to carry me through when I felt stumped on the science. Overall, I'm happy with the results and simultaneously motivated to learn more.

## Modules

I've separated my work into two separate markdown files here: the first describes the processes and commands performed in the terminal, and the second expands on the work done in R to explore the data and create the visualizations. In-depth explanations and a step-by-step approach are included in both.
